/**
 * Bootstrap
 * (sails.config.bootstrap)
 *
 * An asynchronous bootstrap function that runs before your Sails app gets lifted.
 * This gives you an opportunity to set up your data model, run jobs, or perform some special logic.
 *
 * For more information on bootstrapping your app, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.org/#/documentation/reference/sails.config/sails.config.bootstrap.html
